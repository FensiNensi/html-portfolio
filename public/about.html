<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Nensi — a former hospitality worker, future developer, and full-stack enthusiast in training.

For years I balanced trays — now I balance tags. Code became my tool for freedom, and every bug is a chance to learn something new (or drink coffee and scream into a pillow, depending on the day).

I’m currently diving into web development (HTML, CSS, JS, and React), building personal projects, and getting ready for the freelance world. I love clean logic, good design, and an even better Ctrl+Z.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me training judo, standing on my hands, or figuring out how to combine everything I love into one wild and beautiful life.

Need a developer with strong nerves and a sharp eye for detail? Let’s talk!</p>
